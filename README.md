# Burst Integrations
We try to keep Burst Statistics as easy as possible, for anyone interested in configuring their own metrics or UI behaviour you can use MU plugins. If you have an idea, please create an "issue" on Github.

### MU Plugins

**Change Bounce Rate Metric** 

You can change the metric when a pageview should be converted to a bounce. For some website, or loading options you might want to shorten the time period to interaction, or give users a little more time to interact e.g. when using animations or loading screens.

**User role based exclusion** 

Administrators are excluded by default. To exclude more user roles, or custom user roles you can use this MU plugin to improve you data.

**Block IP addresses** 

Blocking IP addresses is a 2 step process; please [this article](https://burst-statistics.com/exclude-ip-addresses-from-burst-statistics/) to get started.
